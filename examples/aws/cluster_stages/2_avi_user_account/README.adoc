= Be Aware
Make sure the project name matches the other steps.
Once you verified the project name set the new password and retrieve the old password from VMware Portal where you get your license.

NOTE: If you forget to do a terraform destroy on this folder, and redeploy it, it will fail. You must remove the terraform state files.

** terraform.tfstate.backup
** terraform.tfstate

*** The passwords are marked as sensitive therefore will not display the data.

  # avi_useraccount.avi_user will be created
  + resource "avi_useraccount" "avi_user" {
      + id           = (known after apply)
      + old_password = (sensitive)
      + password     = (sensitive)
      + username     = "admin"
    }

IMPORANT: If you run this as soon as the Controllers is deployed it will take extra time, about 7min and 30 sec. If you wait 8  mins then the task will be done quickly.
