== Avi Controller

* You will need to make sure to have an IAM role with the options to deploy Avi Controller.

The full schema can be checked from:
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/iam-role-setup-for-installation-into-aws/[Full Role Settings]
Here is a very basic version to allow deployment.
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::avi-se-*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::avi-se-*/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
                "ec2:CopySnapshot",
                "ec2:RegisterImage",
                "ec2:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

Once that's done, create a file named terraform.tfvars to add your password. An example is included as terraform.tfvars.example.

Update the variables to match what will be available into your AWS.


NOTE: if you are going to delete the Avi Controllers and you have deployed the SE, terraform will not be able to finish the task!
Which means you will have to do a lot of manual deletion and then clean up the terraform to get back into the clean state. 

=== Info
This section will generate the SSH keys and it will be injected into the Avi Controller. Then you do have the option to login using the ssh, or username/pass. The password will be set on the next play, even though you do have the variable in the terraform.tfvars. Keep that password the same. 

=== Terraform.tfvars
Here is the example you will want to use and set your variables

----
avi_password = "yournewpasswordgoeshere!@"
aws_vpc_id   = "yourvpcnumberhere"
----

=== Output
The output will show you the Avi Controller and Leader as well as the public IP address. Example of the output

----
avi_controller_iam_role = "remo-avi-controller"
avi_controller_ip = [
  "10.155.251.246",
  "10.155.251.200",
  "10.155.251.212",
]
avi_controller_public_dns = "ec2-52-39-129-160.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com"
avi_controller_public_ip_leader = "52.39.129.160"
aws_controller_instance = [
  "remo-demo-terraform-controller-1",
  "remo-demo-terraform-controller-2",
  "remo-demo-terraform-controller-3",
]
aws_subnets = [
  "remo-demo-terraform-subnet-0",
  "remo-demo-terraform-subnet-1",
  "remo-demo-terraform-subnet-2",
]
subnets = [
  "10.155.251.0/24",
  "10.155.252.0/24",
  "10.155.253.0/24",
]
----
=== Trusted IPs
In order to avoid to have the controller wide open to the web, I created a sec group which will only allow Trusted IPs to connect to the controler. 

example are in the terraform.tfvars.example but it looks like this:
Very important make sure to add the IPs (internal) like you see below 10.155.xx.0 to the list otherwise it fails. 

----
trusted_cidr = ["12.10.13.51/32","9.19.51.25/32","10.155.251.0/24", "10.155.252.0/24", "10.155.253.0/24"]
----


=== Next Step
Before you move on to the next steps, please wait a few min to get the Avi Controller up.
