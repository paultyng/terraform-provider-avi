# avi_serverautoscalepolicy

This data source is used to to get avi_serverautoscalepolicy objects.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "avi_serverautoscalepolicy" "foo_serverautoscalepolicy" {
    uuid = "serverautoscalepolicy-f9cf6b3e-a411-436f-95e2-2982ba2b217b"
    name = "foo"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Optional) Search ServerAutoScalePolicy by name.
* `uuid` - (Optional) Search ServerAutoScalePolicy by uuid.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `delay_for_server_garbage_collection` - Delay in minutes after which a down server will be removed from pool. Value 0 disables this functionality. Field introduced in 20.1.3.
* `description` - User defined description for the object.
* `intelligent_autoscale` - Use avi intelligent autoscale algorithm where autoscale is performed by comparing load on the pool against estimated capacity of all the servers.
* `intelligent_scalein_margin` - Maximum extra capacity as percentage of load used by the intelligent scheme. Scalein is triggered when available capacity is more than this margin. Allowed values are 1-99.
* `intelligent_scaleout_margin` - Minimum extra capacity as percentage of load used by the intelligent scheme. Scaleout is triggered when available capacity is less than this margin. Allowed values are 1-99.
* `labels` - Key value pairs for granular object access control. Also allows for classification and tagging of similar objects. Field introduced in 20.1.3. Maximum of 4 items allowed.
* `max_scalein_adjustment_step` - Maximum number of servers to scalein simultaneously. The actual number of servers to scalein is chosen such that target number of servers is always more than or equal to the min_size.
* `max_scaleout_adjustment_step` - Maximum number of servers to scaleout simultaneously. The actual number of servers to scaleout is chosen such that target number of servers is always less than or equal to the max_size.
* `max_size` - Maximum number of servers after scaleout. Allowed values are 0-400.
* `min_size` - No scale-in happens once number of operationally up servers reach min_servers. Allowed values are 0-400.
* `name` - Name of the object.
* `scalein_alertconfig_refs` - Trigger scalein when alerts due to any of these alert configurations are raised. It is a reference to an object of type alertconfig.
* `scalein_cooldown` - Cooldown period during which no new scalein is triggered to allow previous scalein to successfully complete. Unit is sec.
* `scaleout_alertconfig_refs` - Trigger scaleout when alerts due to any of these alert configurations are raised. It is a reference to an object of type alertconfig.
* `scaleout_cooldown` - Cooldown period during which no new scaleout is triggered to allow previous scaleout to successfully complete. Unit is sec.
* `tenant_ref` - It is a reference to an object of type tenant.
* `use_predicted_load` - Use predicted load rather than current load.
* `uuid` - Unique object identifier of the object.
